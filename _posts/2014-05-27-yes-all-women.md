Elliot Rodger, a former student of University of California, Santa Barbara, killed a [total of six people and injured thirteen others](http://time.com/113948/elliot-rodger-ucsb-santa-barbara/). He then proceeded to kill himself with the same gun.

A quick google search gives his online footprint in various social media and online forums. The posts indicate a need for approval and insecurity in his part, particularly his posts in the forum BodyBuilding.com.

This should have sparked a debate about the gun laws in the US... [and it did](http://time.com/115274/gun-control-santa-barbara/). What seems out of place is that this has also sparked a debate about "men" feeling entitled about women.

These are mostly people with a twitter account who find it a necessity to make this killing only about women. Granted that the killer's intention was in fact to harm and kill women, which is obvious from his "manifesto" which is basically a video wherein he elaborates about his life and how no woman found him attractive or worthy. What is uncalled for is the number of tweets whose only purpose is to make men feel guilty. I'm not hiding behind the so-called "not all men" argument. No, this is not that. I'll agree with other issues like eve teasing, sexism at work place, and problems a women faces on the internet. These are genuine concerns. These happen every day in alarming numbers and need to be checked. What continues to surprise me is the voracity with which pseudo-feminists pull issues towards gender bias in society while the nature of the issue is something else entirely. 

The problem here is not their flawed logic but the diversion of attention from the real issue. One young man, who clearly has mental issues, decided to post numerous material online and send a manifesto to his parents and therapist, and then went on a killing spree _that was clearly aimed at harming women_. The issue here should be gun laws in the United States. It should also be that the video, which clearly violates YouTube TOS, remained online for a few hours without being reported. A timely report could have thwarted his efforts since he identified himself along with a location. There are numerous problems again in monitoring the huge amount of content that gets uploaded on YouTube. These should have been the real issues, suggestions and corrections to the system that could prevent a future catastrophe of this kind. But what it has become is a field day for women and men, whose only takeaway from this incident is that "men" feel entitled about women.

Some tweets are about sexual harassment and assault.

(How this issue is related to rape confounds me.)


Some are about gender bias in the various facets of the society.

None of them are about what could be done to prevent this in the future. None of the raise questions about the upbringing of this young man and how it could have affected him. Shouldn't that be the issue? Shouldn't the issue be that despite several therapists treating him, this killer's misogyny and narcissism was uncurable?

I'll agree that part of this issue is about misogyny but what I won't agree is that it is the *main issue*. This issue is more than about men, women and gender. It is about the sense of entitlement that hovers above the heads of twenty something people. [The millennials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials), as the youngsters born after the 80s and before 2000 are dubbed, are the main issue here. The sense of entitlement that Elliot Rodger's videos and manifesto drips of partly has something to do with our generation and our self-centered lives [[2]](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/05/millennials-the-greatest-generation-or-the-most-narcissistic/256638/), [[3]](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2013/01/15/are-millennials-deluded-narcissists/). This young man did not get laid. It seems it had to do with more than looks, with his own self-image, with his attitude towards women. Whatever it was, it could have been corrected. He held on to an overwhelming belief that things just had to work out well and there was consequent anger when they did not. If this couldn't have been prevented, the effect of it could at least be allayed. Seven dead bodies fell for one man's self-indulgence. That is the issue here.

I'm a feminist. I believe in equal rights for women. I'm a man. I'm sorry about the current state of affairs that the women have to face. I'm sorry that they are frequently abused and mistreated. I'm sorry for everything that a sector of misogynistic men do even though the only thing I have in common with them is my gender. If I held every woman in the same regard as my cheating ex, then it would be my own narrow animus and it would be my loss to not see things as they are.

I'd rather start taking action, taking precautions, educating people, confronting their sexism in reality, face-to-face rather than take to twitter and post vague snippets of personal experience that reiterate the problems that women face. I'd rather talk about solutions and measures that can prevent another killing.

Does it do well to bash "men" in general, criticize "the culture", or call "men" out on their urges to rape amidst an issue of narcissistic killers? Does it do well to treat this as an opportunity to type out 140 characters of "men do this" and "men do that"? I do not think so. 

Yet again, we have boiled down a complex multi-faceted issue to something binary - a moral reiteration of feminism and a renewed hatred for "men" (misogynistic ones only, others excuse yourself, thank you).
